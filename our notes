15AUG2017 - Add options to picknplot

1. Figure out saving from rgl machine - DONE
2. Add method to arguments (copy MikeÂ´s option l. 76 of plotRefToTarget) - DONE
3. Check dim(A) (copy l. 82 of plotRefToTarget) - DONE
4. Allow rotation for real 3d shapes, but not for 2d - DONE
5. Ellipsis programming to pass plotRefToTarget arguments - DONE
6. Add point to the clicked point selected by the user in the biplot - DONE
7. Ask user: save grid? - DONE BUT NOT OPTIMIZED

TO DO NEXT (AK 15AUG2017)
- Figure out how to make rgl.snapshot work OK when the user provides file name as a string. At present it only works if you do not put quotes to it

- Improve shape.animation() options. Do we want to add an option for saving as video? In the future, this may be generalized as a wrapper of shape.predictor()

- Solve functions for method = "TPS"
