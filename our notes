CHECKS TO PICKNPLOT
- cf if user can pass title arg

CREATE PCA FUNCTION (S3) - GM.prcomp
- make S3 class "GMpca" so it can be read by picknplot

26SEP2017
- for regular, return PCscores (NOT adjusted for phylo.mean) and ancestors
- for phylo.pca, return phylo PCscores and ancestors
- remember to keep line 80 of plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace for plotting

2OCT2017
- l.78 of plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace - why PCA on extant and ancestral states? 
Shouldn't this be the PCA on the raw data, and then project the ancs on that for plotting?

- joined picknplot with animation. Some issues:
  1. method = "TPS" does not work in the animation
  2. outline arg of plotRefToTarget does not work in either version
  

FOR FUTURE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PLOTTING FUNCTIONS (AK note 17SEP)
- attribute specific S3 classes to analytical functions (pca, pls, allometry, anova etc)
- plot(bla) then calls the specific plotting tools for each, i.e. plot.pca, plot.pls etc
- picknplot(plot(bla)) to enable clicking in the plot to see shapes
- Expand options to make it work with other plots (allometry, pls). 
For this we need to create specific S3 classes to be read by picknplot
   - So if its a PCA: A= 3d array, x = 2d matrix of PC scores, Intercept = FALSE
   - for Allometry: A= 3d array, x = log centroid size, Intercept = TRUE
   - or: A= 3d array, x = Reg.proj, Intercept = FALSE
   - or: A= 3d array, x = pred.val, Intercept = FALSE
   - PLS: A= 3d array, x = the other matrix/array, Intercept = FALSE, method = PLS
