15AUG2017 - Add options to picknplot
1. Figure out saving from rgl machine - DONE
2. Add method to arguments (copy MikeÂ´s option l. 76 of plotRefToTarget) - DONE
3. Check dim(A) (copy l. 82 of plotRefToTarget) - DONE
4. Allow rotation for real 3d shapes, but not for 2d - DONE
5. Ellipsis programming to pass plotRefToTarget arguments - DONE
6. Add point to the clicked point selected by the user in the biplot - DONE
7. Ask user: save grid? - DONE
8. Return coordinates in console of picked point - DONE
 
5SEP 2017 - TO DO NEXT
- Solve 3d plotting in rgl machine (needs modification of plotRefToTarget)
- Improve shape.animation() options. Do we want to add an option for saving as video? In the future, this may be generalized as a wrapper of shape.predictor()
- Add while loop to keep picknplot running until the user wants to stop - DONE
- Expand options to make it work with other plots (allometry, pls). 
For this we need to create specific S3 classes to be read by picknplot

CHECKS TO PICKNPLOT
- cf 3d normal plotting
- cf if user can pass title arg

CREATE PCA FUNCTION (S3) - GM.prcomp
- merge analytical and output parts of plotTangentSpace and plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace
- make S3 class "GMpca" so it can be read by picknplot
