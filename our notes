CHECKS TO PICKNPLOT
- cf if user can pass title arg

CREATE PCA FUNCTION (S3) - GM.prcomp
- make S3 class "GMpca" so it can be read by picknplot

03OCT2017
- Need to check pPCA against phytools implementation
- Need to return original data if we do phylomorphospace plotting the old way (PCA of shape data and anc states) [but address comment from 20OCT below]

26SEP2017
- for regular, return PCscores (NOT adjusted for phylo.mean) and ancestors
- for phylo.pca, return phylo PCscores and ancestors
- remember to keep line 80 of plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace for plotting

2OCT2017
- l.78 of plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace - why PCA on extant and ancestral states? 
Shouldn't this be the PCA on the raw data, and then project the ancs on that for plotting?

- joined picknplot with animation. Some issues:
  1. method = "TPS" does not work in the animation
  2. outline arg of plotRefToTarget does not work in either version
  
FOR FUTURE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PLOTTING FUNCTIONS (AK note 17SEP)
- attribute specific S3 classes to analytical functions (pca, pls, allometry, anova etc)
- plot(bla) then calls the specific plotting tools for each, i.e. plot.pca, plot.pls etc
- picknplot(plot(bla)) to enable clicking in the plot to see shapes
- Expand options to make it work with other plots (allometry, pls). 
For this we need to create specific S3 classes to be read by picknplot
   - So if its a PCA: A= 3d array, x = 2d matrix of PC scores, Intercept = FALSE
   - for Allometry: A= 3d array, x = log centroid size, Intercept = TRUE
   - or: A= 3d array, x = Reg.proj, Intercept = FALSE
   - or: A= 3d array, x = pred.val, Intercept = FALSE
   - PLS: A= 3d array, x = the other matrix/array, Intercept = FALSE, method = PLS


AK - 20NOV2017
##############
Implemented rawPCA, anc+tipsPCA and phyloPCA as per e-mail string with DCA and MMC (6OCT2017)
Function:
  1) retrieves PCA options
  2) does centering and scaling (if desired)
  3) calculates shape ancs and stucks these to tip data (for phylomorphospace version)
  4) does phylogenetic transformation (for phyloPCA version)
  5) trims axes depending on tol
- NEED TO CONFIRM ORDER OF OPERATIONS (i.e. centering, phylo, trimming)

- line 43-45: Catch for double weighting (phylo and COV matrix). Should be stop or warning?
- Added COV argument to allow for weighting with a different cov matrix (e.g. spatial)
- Added function (cov.mat) to allow standardizing by this matrix (similar to phylo.mat)

- Started building support.gm.prcomp to join plotting functions

# Pending implementation:
- catches for inputting procD.lm results (and NOT procD.pgls)
- need to test what happens if input is procD.pgls - standardized data and you apply ppca to them
